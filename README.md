## Description

**AdminPBuster** is a Red Teaming Recon tool to find hidden admin panels on web applications using brute-forcing.  
Instead of bundling a static wordlist and bloating the tool, it **fetches an updated admin panel wordlist** directly from our GitHub repository.

- This keeps the tool **lightweight** and **easy to maintain**.
- Whenever we update the hosted wordlist, **the tool automatically benefits**, without needing to update the script itself.

**Key technical goodies:**
- Multithreaded scanning using curl
- Proper HTTPS and `www.` handling to fix SSL issues
- Real redirect following (`-L` curl flag) bypasses WAFs and Cloudflare protections and log only the valid 200 Responses
- No proxychains/Tor dependency (due to their unreliability for professional offensive operations)
- Optional randomized User-Agent headers (`-ua`) to simulate real traffic

AdminPBuster focuses on **speed**, **reliability**, and **accuracy** while staying very simple to operate going through 10,000+ wordlists.

---

## The Flow Behind It

- **Fetch Updated Wordlist**  
  Downloads the latest `magic_admin_paths.txt` from GitHub automatically.

- **Prepare Target Domain**  
  Adds `www.` if missing, forces HTTPS, solving common SSL and cert mismatch problems.

- **Build and Launch Curl Requests**  
  Constructs lightweight curl calls to quickly test admin paths with correct flags.

- **Multithreaded Scanning**  
  Scans many paths at once using multiple threads to improve speed.

- **Color-Coded Result Parsing**  
  Displays results with colors based on HTTP response codes for easy reading:
  - 200 (OK) in green
  - 301/302 (Redirects) in cyan
  - 403 (Forbidden) in yellow
  - 404 (Not Found) in red
  - Other codes in magenta

- **Log Successful Admin Panels**  
  Admin panels found (200 OK) are automatically saved inside a folder under `results/{target_domain}/found_panels.txt`.
